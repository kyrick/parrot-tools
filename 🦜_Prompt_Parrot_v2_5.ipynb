    "# Welcome to Prompt Parrot! ðŸ¦œ\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to train language model on a list of your prompts,generate prompts in your style, and synthesize wonderful surreal images! âœ¨ \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is created and maintained by [Stephen Young](https://twitter.com/KyrickYoung) or SteveTheNinja#0616 on discord\n",
    "\n",
    "# Models Used\n",
    "- Prompt Parrot is primarily powered by `distilgpt2`, which is a finetuned [GPT-2 model by huggingface](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2). \n",
    "- And [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) for image generation a diffusion made by CompVis in colaboration with Stability AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Changelog\n",
    "###2.0\n",
    "- Streamlined model training UX!\n",
    "- Added ability to save multiple finetuned models! \n",
    "- Gave the parrot a paintbrush! Prompt Parrot will now generate images with Stable Diffusion!\n",
    "- Added image grid options\n",
    "- Provided a list of default prompts! Prompt Parrot now works out of the box! \n",
    "- Added NSFW retry setting. The parrot will try another seed until finally giving up in shame that it can't generate a SFW image.\n",
    "\n",
    "###2.1\n",
    "- Added ability to create multiple grids! More grids, more fun!\n",
    "- Sneaked in extra prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "###2.2\n",
    "- Silence the image progress bar. This was a major performance bottleneck. Stable Diffusion is VERY fast\n",
    "\n",
    "###2.3\n",
    "- Implement prompt-parrot common gen functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5\n",
    "- Completely overhauled the training strategy! Generated prompts are more coherent. \n",
    "- Added ~30 more prompts!! The new total is 185 built-in prompts\n",
    "- Added prompt overrides so you can select fewer prompts to run and edit them. This will override all generated prompts. To undo simply delete the overrides.\n",
    "- Improved hyperparameter instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has two primary finetuning modes:\n",
    "1. Train on built in prompts\n",
    "1. Train on a prompt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1) Builtin Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Run all cells! Default settings will use the builtin prompts by default, train GP2 and produce art!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2) Prompt File\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a text file with all of your prompts!\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Prompt Parrot requires a minimum of 30 prompts to train effectively.** Less will work, but the results will tend to overfit. More than 50 prompts is ideal! The more the merrier. Try to get as many prompts as you can into the text file!\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example prompt file:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    a beautiful painting of a mountain by Tyler Edlin, trending on arstation\n",
    "    a stunning painting of Chicago, oil and canvas\n",
    "    cyberpunk hoover dam, cgsociety, artstation, highly detailed matte painting\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next upload your file to the session\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![upload_icon.png](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14Is1KFTqpRwqeCWuIPC3StQsAbmG6als)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally copy the path to your uploaded file and paste it below!\n",

    "Prompt Parrot will train on the prompts provided for the number of epochs specified. The more epochs, the longer training will take. But the results will be more accurate to your prompts. If you train too long the Parrot will overfit and produce your prompts exactly. Prompt Parrot handles prompt diversity pretty well. In fact, diverse prompts generally produce better results. If a word or phrase is repeated too much the parrot will fixate on it. This may be good or bad depending on how often you want the modifier to appear in your prompt generations.\n",
